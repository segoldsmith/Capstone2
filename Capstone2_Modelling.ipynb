    "This model performs better than XGBoost and the 1st LightGBM model in all metrics/ Based on this, the 2nd LightGBM model is the best model to use of the model's tested. That being said, there is much room for improvement. Currently, this model only explains approximately 16% of the variance in the data.\n",
